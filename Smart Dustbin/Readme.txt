This is a Smart Dustbin Project created using Arduino Programming.

Components: Arduino Board, Ultrasonic sensor, Servo Motor, Bin Bucket without Lid, Cardboard.


1.This dustbin detects the hand at a certain distance from sensor.

2.It has a direct connection to servo motor.

3.When the hand is moved away, the servo motor returns back to its original state making the bin closed.

4.It is just a small model representation of Smart Dustbin, It can also be performed on a large scale with more 
  powerful motors and sensors.


Learning Outcomes: From this I learnt the use of Arduino, Ultrasonic sensors, servo motor and how to make connections
	           between all of them.
